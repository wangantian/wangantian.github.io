Computer design is the science and art of selecting and interconnecting hardware components to build a computer that meets functional, performance, and cost goals. In this course, students will learn to design a uniprocessor computer system, including processor datapath, processor control, memory systems, and I/O. The course provides a thorough and detailed treatment of basic computer arithmetic algorithms, multi-cycle implementations of modern computer instruction sets, pipelined CPU designs, design of cache hierarchy and virtual memory, and fundamentals of computer system I/O. The course also includes evaluation and analysis of processor and memory performance.

<h2>Course Coverage</h2>
The course discusses the latest RISC-V instruction set architecture. The modules of the course include:

<ul>
  <li>Introduction</li>
  <li>Number system, last dance, including floating point operations, floating point pitfall moment, unum/posit,</li>
  <li>Computer performance evaluation, including Performance (time/Iron law), Power, and Area (PPA) consumption </li>
  <li>RISC-V assembly programming and instruction set</li>
  <li>Single cycle and pipelined RISC-V processor design; structure/data/control hazards; Additional discussions on processor varations, including out-of-order/ multi-issue/ multi-cycle processors</li>
  <li>Memory circuit premier, cache and memory hierarchy and their performance evaluation; Virtual memory; memory-centric computing, and latest advancement of memory technology </li>
  <li>Parallel computing, including domain-specific accelerators.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lab Component</h2>

The lab component is expected to strengthen students' comprehension of the lecture portion of the course. Currently, the lab part composes of [Lab 01 Floating Point Unit Design](#lab01), [Lab 02 RISC-V Assembly Programming](#lab02), [Lab 03 Single-cycle processor design](#lab03), [Lab 04 5-stage pipelined processor design](#lab04), [Lab 05 Memory system design](#lab05)
