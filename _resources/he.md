* Open Cheetah-Alibaba [https://github.com/Alibaba-Gemini-Lab/OpenCheetah](https://github.com/Alibaba-Gemini-Lab/OpenCheetah)
After initial dependencies installation from a fresh Ubuntu, 
You may face the issue stated here with no emp-ot
[https://github.com/Alibaba-Gemini-Lab/OpenCheetah/issues/4]([https://github.com/Alibaba-Gemini-Lab/OpenCheetah/issues/4])
)
The way to solve it is to install emp-op dependent library first, and then redo it.
You need to have two terminal to make it running.
