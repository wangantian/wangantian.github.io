## Theoretical backgrounds:
### BFV/BGV

### CKKS 

### FHEW/TFHE


## Software libraries:
* OpenFHE [https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development)
* TFHE-rs/ZAMA [https://github.com/zama-ai/tfhe-rs](TFHE-rs/ZAMA)
* SEAL [https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL)
* Open Cheetah-Alibaba [https://github.com/Alibaba-Gemini-Lab/OpenCheetah](https://github.com/Alibaba-Gemini-Lab/OpenCheetah)
After initial dependencies installation from a fresh Ubuntu, 
You may face the issue stated here with no emp-ot
https://github.com/Alibaba-Gemini-Lab/OpenCheetah/issues/4
The way to solve it is to install emp-op dependent library first, and then redo it.
You need to have two terminal to make it running.
